Summary
--

Highlight all occurrences of selected text, with or without a keypress. Works on all sites, including GitHub, StackOverflow, HackerNews, etc. Does not replace within Input, TextArea, ContentEditable Divs, or iFrames for conformity and security reasons. Unfortunately, some sites and ancestor DOM nodes should be blacklisted (usually code-editors), as they micro-manage using unpredictable DOM depth and selectors. See the Options page for JSON configuration.
